`Infrared Data Protocol 8` - `AVR ATtiny85` `(avr-asm)`

# Abstract
This repository contains a bare-bones implementation of a `3 bit` `IR` data protocol using the `AVR` architecture, providing the means for basic short range robotics control.

# Firmware Features
1. Variable `38kHz` `IR` transmitter burst time (protocol independent).
2. Pulse delay encoding.
3. Simple data transmission error checking.
4. High noise immunity.
5. Uses internal `8MHz` `RC` oscillator.
6. Timer resolution of `100Î¼s`. 
7. Fully configurable and extensible.

# Warnings
The sample protocol provided is only intended to be used by one transmitter-receiver pair.

> Note: The addition of multiple transmitters may cause data corruption or other unknown side effects. <br>

# Info
Included in the main source files is a led demo. <br>
Four leds can be controlled remotely using four tacticle push-buttons.  Schematics for the project are provided.

Folders:
* `/firmware` - `TX and RX assembly firmware`.
* `/schematics` - `circuit schematics for transmitter and receiver`.
* `/spec` - `IDP Protocol specification`.
